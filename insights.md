# EXPLORE Phase - Mistral Training Pipeline Insights

## Current Repository State Analysis

### Documentation Claims vs Reality
- **MISTRAL_POLICY_CORPUS_COMPLETION_REPORT.md**: Claims policy analysis model is "COMPLETED" and deployed at `54.197.142.172:8001`
- **complete_mistral_qlora_training_guide.md**: Comprehensive 2000+ line guide claiming completed training
- **Reality Check Needed**: These appear to be documentation of a previous/different project, not current state

### Available Pipeline Components
1. **Data Preparation**: `prepare_mistral_dataset.py` - modular dataset prep pipeline
2. **Training Script**: `train_mistral_simple.py` - clean training implementation
3. **Infrastructure**: `deploy_mistral_to_g5.sh` - deployment automation
4. **Corpus**: 6000+ entries in `/data/corpus/` across multiple domains

### Key Infrastructure Elements
- Stopped g4dn.xlarge instance in us-west-2 (i-077185824897aaa34)
- Deployment scripts configured for us-west-2 region
- Security groups and networking scripts ready

### Data Pipeline Analysis
- **Local Corpus**: ~6K entries in JSONL format ready for use
- **S3 Dependencies**: Pipeline expects policy-database bucket (may not exist)
- **Processing Chain**: corpus → operatives → combined → train/val split

### Critical Gaps Identified
1. **No Actual Trained Model**: Documentation describes completed training but no artifacts found
2. **Instance State**: Training instance exists but stopped
3. **Corpus vs Reality**: Local corpus ready, but pipeline tries to download from S3
4. **Policy Focus**: Existing docs focus on policy analysis, user wants general Mistral training

## Recommendations for Plan Phase

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Clarify Training Objective**: Policy analysis vs general purpose vs domain-specific
2. **Data Strategy**: Use local corpus vs attempt S3 download vs collect new data  
3. **Instance Strategy**: Restart existing vs launch fresh g5.2xlarge
4. **Scope Definition**: Full pipeline vs focused training run

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium Risk**: S3 dependencies may fail (policy-database bucket)
- **Low Risk**: Local corpus appears sufficient for training
- **Medium Risk**: Documentation suggests previous project artifacts that may conflict

### Next Steps for Planning
1. Define specific training objectives
2. Choose data sources (local corpus vs S3 vs new collection)
3. Select infrastructure approach (existing instance vs new deployment)
4. Create executable implementation plan with clear deliverables
